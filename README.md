# Data Analyst Portfolio

A clean, responsive portfolio website for showcasing data analysis work, projects, and experience. The site uses a dark theme with a modern UI and simple navigation.

## Overview

- Highlights recent projects with concise summaries and tools used.
- Includes sections for About, Resume, Portfolio, Blog, and Contact.
- Lightweight stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for easy customization and hosting.

## Structure

- `index.html` — main markup and content
- `assets/css/style.css` — theme and layout styles
- `assets/js/script.js` — navigation, filters, and small UI behaviors
- `assets/images/` — project images and icons

## Projects

Each project card is designed to communicate quickly:
- Title — clear and descriptive
- Summary — 2–3 lines on objective and outcome
- Tools — e.g., SQL, Python, Power BI, scikit‑learn
- Links (optional) — GitHub repo, live dashboard, or write‑up

Edit the sample cards in the “Projects” section of `index.html` and replace with your own details and links.

## Getting Started

- Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve locally for better routing and assets:
  - Python: `python -m http.server 5500` → http://localhost:5500
  - VS Code: Live Server extension

## Customize

- Content: Update text in `index.html` for About, Resume, Projects, Portfolio, Blog, and Contact.
- Images: Replace assets in `assets/images/` and update paths in HTML.
- Styles: Tweak colors, spacing, and typography in `assets/css/style.css`.
- Icons: Use `<ion-icon>` elements already present in the HTML if desired.

## Deployment

- GitHub Pages: push to the default branch, then enable Pages (root `/`).
- Netlify/Vercel: connect the repository or drag‑and‑drop the folder.
